/*
 * INPUT TO THE EXISTS/FORALL SOLVER
 */

/*
 * Data structure to store an exist/forall problem.
 * The basic form is 
 *
 *    A(x) AND (FORALL y: B(y) => C(x, y))
 *
 * and the goal is to find x that satisfies this constraint.
 *
 * We take a set of input formulas [f1, ... f_n] and attempt to write
 * them in the above form. We report an error if we can't do it.
