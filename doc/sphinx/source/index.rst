Yices's documentation (version 2.2.0)
=====================================

Yices is an SMT solver developed in
`SRI International <http://www.sri.com/>`_'s
`Computer Science Laboratory <http://www.sri.com/about/organization/information-computing-sciences/computer-science-laboratory>`_.

Yices decides the satisfiability of formulas containing uninterpreted
function symbols, linear real and integer arithmetic, scalar types,
tuples, arrays, and bitvectors.

One can interact with Yices using scripts in the Yices input language,
or using the `SMT-LIB <http://www.smtlib.org/>`_ notation. Yices can
also be used as a library via its C-API.

This documentation describes the Yices input language and the Yices
API.  For more information about SMT-LIB, please consult the `SMT-LIB
<http://www.smtlib.org/>`_ website  or David Cock's
`SMT-LIB Tutorial <http://www.grammatech.com/resource/smt/SMTLIBTutorial.pdf>`_.
