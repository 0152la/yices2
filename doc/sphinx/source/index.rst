Yices's documentation (version 2.2.0)
=====================================

Yices is an SMT solver developed in 
`SRI International <http://www.sri.com/>`_'s 
`Computer Science Laboratory <http://www.sri.com/about/organization/information-computing-sciences/computer-science-laboratory>`_.

Yices decides the satisfiability of formulas containing uninterpreted
function symbols, linear real and integer arithmetic, scalar types,
tuples, arrays, and bitvectors. One can interact with Yices using
scripts in the Yices input language, or using the 
`SMT-LIB <http://www.smtlib.org/>`_ notation. Yices can also be used as a
library via its C-API.
