   Display Area


All pretty-printing operations use a rectangular display area
characterized by its width, height, and offset as shown in Figure
:ref:`ppbox`. The width and offset are measured in number of columns,
and the height is a number of lines. The offset is the distance
relative to the beginning of the line.
