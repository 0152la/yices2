Short term plan to gain momentum.

Incorporate the locking code and write some mutltithreaded tests.
Use valgrind (helgrind) to detect races.
Go from there.


autoconf
./configure --enable-mcsat
make MODE=debug



To build the tests:

make MODE=debug test

(tests end up in the build/*/bin directory)


__yices_globals no longer starts out zeroed.

There is some thread local stuff in the configure file.

BD: do we want to make thread safety  an "option"


N.B.:

yices_lock_free.h is a lock_free version of the api
