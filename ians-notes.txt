Short term plan to gain momentum (currently developing ONLY on linux).

Incorporate the locking code and write some mutltithreaded tests.
Use valgrind (helgrind) to detect races.
Go from there.


autoconf
./configure --enable-mcsat
make MODE=debug



To build the tests:

make MODE=debug test

(tests end up in the build/*/bin directory)



BD: do we want to make thread safety  an "option"

BD: overhead of error_report vs new blocks?

N.B.:

yices_lock_free.h is a lock_free version of the api


The following API functions are not thread safe. Norr should
we attempt to make them so. It should be well documented.

<non-thread-safe api routines>
 void yices_init(void);
 void yices_exit(void);
 void yices_reset(void);
</non-thread-safe api routines>

Things like term verctors are not protected. You should not pass them from thread to thread
unless you, qua user, protect them.


problematic (assumming it is not the case that HAVE_TLS:

<problematic>
 error_report_t *yices_error_report(void);
 error_report_t *yices_get_error_report(void);
 error_code_t yices_error_code(void);
 void yices_clear_error(void);
 int32_t yices_print_error(FILE *f);
 ...
</problematic>
